# CrazySonic: Super Ultra Cool Bodacious Radical Mega CD Remastered Edition!!!

This is the source code for CrazySonic: Super Ultra Cool Bodacious Radical Mega CD Remastered Edition!!! Mainly just here for archival, but feel free to take a gander at it if you like. This was rushed out in just 2 weeks for Sonic Hacking Contest 2023, so the code may appear messy and maybe even buggy. I did go out of my way to fix the more glaring issues, though.
